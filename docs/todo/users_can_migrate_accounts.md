We should add functionality to enable users to switch their google account over
to another address and Calendar. If nothing else, we need to allow users to link
other accounts together, so that they can read from multiple account's calendars
if desired.

To achieve this, we could maybe use email verification. However, another
alternative would be in having them create another account, perhaps a special
type of account, a "link account", could allow users to only offer calendar, or
email permissions for another particular account, perhaps one they want to use
for us to send emails to, or to read the calendar from.

To migrate an account, we could have a migration option in a user's profile
options, and clicking on that would give you a form field to type in the email
of the account you want to migrate to. Then you would register with that second
account (if not already done), log on to it, and you should have a notification
to accept the migration (which would be a button option within your profile
settings).
