# ClientProfile Model

A Client Profile is a set of configuration options that a user can set for a
particular client that they bill to. A user can have many Client Profiles. Each
Client Profile contains information used to fetch and filter the appropriate
calendar entries, and generate a valid invoice from them.

Client Profiles contain options for how the user would like to bill a Client,
such as on a recurring, date-based basis, or after every X number of hours.
