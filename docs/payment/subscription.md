## When a Subscription ends

We should notify them through email.

We should bar a user from accessing any creation or editing features, but not
from printing out any of their old invoices.

User's should not be able to utilize our service's reminders, but they should
not have any experience where any of their important data is no longer
accessible to them. We should clearly communicate that their invoices can be
accessed at any time.
